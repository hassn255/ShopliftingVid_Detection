# Human Pose Estimation (HPE)

This folder contains the initial experiments for integrating Human Pose Estimation (HPE) into the shoplifting detection pipeline.

Due to limited performance and accuracy in the current setup, we decided to proceed without HPE in the main project.
Future versions may include a more optimized or advanced HPE model to improve motion and behavior understanding.
